## The trouble of OBS knob

Is it the inbound course or the reciprocal of the inbound course( i.e. the radial out of that navaid that you’re flying to ) that I twist the OBS knob to? Well, not the first time I asked my self that question on a flight, or worse, on a checkride..

Simply put, you want the TO and FROM flag on a RMI or a HSI to indicate your aircraft’s correct relation to that navaid. Wether it be headed to the navaid or flying away from it, you want that flag to indicate exactly that. And the OBS dialed to your track that’s in close agreement with your current aircraft heading, and the current radial you’re on gonna always be on the opposite end of the TO/FROM flag.

If you were headed to Dinkelsbuhl Vortac(just so happen I have my approach plate on ILS RWY25 into Niederstetten, and if you were executing the DKB 4M out of Nürnburg RWY10) tracking 074-R. Your TO/FROM would be indicating TO, the head of your HSI needle should be pointing to 254deg with the OBS dialed to 254. Realizing that you’re flying to the Vortac on the 074 radial, if you incorrectly had 074 dialed on the OBS, your head of the needle would then be pointing at 074, TO/FROM flag would’ve swapped as if you had suddenly turned a 180 and decided to fly away from the fix( this would have caused the coupled Flight Director to turn a 180 on you!)
