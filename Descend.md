## The world of the slide rules

Pilots at times have the need to calculate descent/ascent rate at given airspeeds and descend/ascend angles. I was taught the simple way of calculating it on the E6B(circular version of the slide rules), but not a lot of users can explain why that simple operation works… but worry not, you don’t get dubbed as the Georgia Tech alum without being able to answer such questions…

* Tan(theta) can be approximated as theta/57 for small thetas. Which is the case for descend angles, such as 2.7deg, 3deg.nd the current radial you’re on gonna always be on the opposite end of the TO/FROM flag.

* Descend ascend rates are usually given as feet per nautical mile(FPNM), aircraft speed is given in knots(Nautical Mile/Hour). Dimensional analysis of the two units of speed gives a “unit ratio”. That is, in the world of slide rules, unit scales are irrelevant, it is up to the users to determine where to place that decimal point! Conversion from FPNM to knots(kts) is merely a factor of .001, or in the eyes of a slide rule, they are the same units.
